1. 7-segment Display Decoder: Design a 4-bit binary to 7-segment display decoder that converts a 4-bit binary input into signals to drive a 7-segment display.
2. PWM Generator: Implement a basic Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) generator with adjustable duty cycle and frequency.
3. N-bit Register File: Design a register file with 4 registers, each 8 bits wide, with read and write functionality.
4. Simple Debounce Circuit: Implement a debouncing circuit for a single push-button input to ensure clean transitions.
